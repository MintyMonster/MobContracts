# These are the possible types of mobs that the contract can be.
# Please ensure the mob-type is a hostile mob, otherwise targeting won't work and they won't attack.

# Note:
# - Creeper will not do anything because it needs to explode
# - Guardian/Elder Guardian needs water
# - Phantom is really annoying lmao
# - Witches are a little useless
# - MagmaCube and Slime break the plugin
